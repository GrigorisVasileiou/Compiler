A full compiler implementation written in Python 3.11 for a custom programming language that uses Greek keywords and syntax. The project includes all major phases of a real compiler: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic checks, intermediate code generation, symbol table management, and final RISC-V assembly output. The main program is the 'greek++_compiler.py' file and there are three tests about it. For each test there is the initial '.gr' program, the intermediate '.int' code and the final '.asm' program in assembly.
